##  Computer Interconnection Structures: Taxonomy, Characteristics, and Examples

As a undergraduate student, this paper was so interesting to me. There are many ways to connect computers in the world, and this paper tries to categorize them.

From personal experiences I thought computer network and multiprocessing are very different thing. But they were not. In "connecting computers" point of view, SMP (Shared Memory Processsors) and computers in my home network are not that different things. They are just a different way to connect computers.
